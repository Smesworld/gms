## General Management System Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

### Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) and `npm run testwatch` in order to watch for changes while running the tests. With `npm run testcoverage` it can be generated a coverage report.

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Documentation

This uses [compodoc](https://github.com/compodoc/compodoc) for generating the app documentation. So you can:

- Run `npm run builddoc` in order to build the documentation resources.
- Run `npm run servedoc` once you built the documentation resources and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.
- Run `npm run buildservedoc` in order to build and serve the documentation resources. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.

All documentation resources are stored in the `documentation/` directory.
