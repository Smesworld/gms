In order to get access to the api resources a login must be performed before, by providing a valid login data.
Each resource can be accessed under specific(s) role(s). Depending on the user's role, some resources may be available
or not.

[[security-login]]
=== Login
A `POST` request which gets a new access token and other necessary data for getting access to protected resources.

=== Example request (successful)
include::{snippets}/login-o-k/curl-request.adoc[]

=== Example response for a successful authentication
include::{snippets}/login-o-k/http-response.adoc[]

=== Example request (unsuccessful)
include::{snippets}/login-k-o/curl-request.adoc[]

=== Example response for an unsuccessful authentication
include::{snippets}/login-k-o/http-response.adoc[]

When the authentication is successful the following information is provided.
include::{snippets}/login-k-o/response-fields.adoc[]

After getting the login information successfully, this must be used in order to access protected resources. An example of
successful subsequent request using this information is the following:
include::{snippets}/list-permissions/curl-request.adoc[]

Notice the 'Authorization' header sent which contains the token type (or scheme) which is 'Bearer', followed by a whitespace
and the token provided in the login information.

If a protected resource is tried to be accessed and this information is not provided properly this will result in an
unsuccessful response like the one previously shown.
